# Team Oops project week one summary

Our project has been modified from a file server to a needed task of fixing a community issue 
of shared classroom computers. We have been tasked with coming up with a netboot and imaging 
solution as well as handling network operations. We will be configuring a raspberry pi 3 to 
become a server capable of deploying Windows 7 to multiple units.

## So far

The first week has been used as an overall research week with a concentration of a path being
being developed each week. The majority of my research in week one has been online through 
youtube videos and multiple instructionable documents. I have been familiarizing myself with 
netbooting and iPXE technology as it is something brand new to myself.

##### Proceeding

Overall this is a large amount of new material to understand and deploy. As we move forward I
imagine I will be given a refined concentrated path to focus on within the group. As my knowledge 
grows I would like to try using multiple raspberry pi's I have at home to try a small scale 
model network install. I believe the hands on approach is the best way to learn for myself.
How much Microsoft technology will we use in our server if any? Will the network cards support PXE?
What packages should be included in the Computer Science computers we are working with?
Hopefully each week these questions I have will be answered and understood.
